# MemoVista 

**MemoVista** is a virtual memory simulator that visually demonstrates **page replacement algorithms** and the **Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB)**. It is designed to help students and developers understand how operating systems manage memory using concepts like FIFO, LRU, and Optimal algorithms.
